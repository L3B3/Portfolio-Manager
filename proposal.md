# Portfolio Management Proposal

## The Big Idea
This project is designed to help young investors understand the performance and diversification of their portfolios. I will build a Portfolio Analyzer that uses Python to calculate performance, diversification, and risk metrics using live market data.

The main requirement is allowing the user to upload historical and positional data. This project will use the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve price history and current market data. Using this information, the project will calculate total portfolio value, gain/loss, portfolio weights, and display these metrics through performance visualizations.

A stretch goal is to add forecasting features using simple regression and an LSTM model. If this forecasting component cannot be completed within the project timeline, the model will be expanded and improved after the initial deadline. I also plan to build a website interface that is visually clear and easy to use.

## Learning Objectives
The learning goals for this project include:

- Becoming comfortable with using external APIs  
- Learning visualization libraries such as Plotly and Matplotlib  
- Applying financial modeling logic  
- Beginning work toward creating a forecasting model for future accuracy improvements  

## Implementation Plan
The project will be separated into five parts:

1. Repository setup  
2. Implementing price fetching and initial financial calculations  
3. Analyzing the contents of the portfolio  
4. Building a visual website to present the information  
5. Polishing the interface and improving usability  

## Project Schedule
**Week 1 (Nov 15–21):** API setup and analytical calculations  
**Week 2 (Nov 22–28):** Visualization and website development  
**Week 3 (Nov 29–Dec 5):** Polishing, documentation, and final code submission  

## Collaboration Plan
This is an individual project. I will update the README as progress is made and regularly commit changes to the public repository.

## Risks and Limitations
The major risks include API updates, handling constantly changing market data, managing multiple file components, and working within the time constraints of the semester.

## Additional Course Content
Additional helpful content would include:

- File management techniques  
- More information on visualization libraries  
- Strategies for reducing runtime and improving performance
